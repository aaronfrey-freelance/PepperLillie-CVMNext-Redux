* Add mechanism for managing new “Project Type” pages (page two of attached)

The pages themselves can be just like the Services or Markets pages, but with one exception:

On these pages, in the right-hand column, can we have an option of making those photos live (like the service page, leading to project descriptions) or just roll-overs (like the markets page, revealing just the client and project)?
